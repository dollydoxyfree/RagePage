# Project Overview

## What GRINDS My Gears (WGMG)
Mindful Venting

## Description

Sometimes things don't go your way, or someone (or something) REALLY gets under your skin, rubs you the wrong way, chaps your --- well you get the picture... This app will provide a safe and fun way to VENT in an anonymous fashion that will aide in bringing the user mindfulness instead of releasing the toxic energy into the world that they so desire.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding and vision of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. As such, I can better plan for what needs to be done and how long it will take. I also know which labs and lectures I can reference if I get lost along the way.

### Weaknesses:

I have a better understanding of functional components but I may want to explore the option of gaining a better understanding of class components to implement into the project.

### Opportunities:

Once MVP is met I am really hoping to strengthen and really broaden my skillset with CSS and experiment with Animation and exploring different libraries.

### Threats:

I need to time-box issues as they arise as I will tend to go into a deep rabbit hole of trying to solve the problem that just might need a set of fresh eyes or a break away from the computer.
